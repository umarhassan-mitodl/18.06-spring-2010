Course Meeting Times
--------------------

Lectures: 3 sessions / week, 1 hour / session

Recitations: 1 session / week, 1 hour / session

Prerequisites
-------------

Multivariable Calculus (18.02)

Text
----

The readings are assigned in: Strang, Gilbert. _Introduction to Linear Algebra_. 4th ed. [Wellesley-Cambridge Press](http://www.wellesleycambridge.com/), 2009. ISBN: 9780980232714.

Reading assignments are also provided for the newer edition: Strang, Gilbert. _Introduction to Linear Algebra_. 5th ed. [Wellesley-Cambridge Press](http://www.wellesleycambridge.com/), 2016. ISBN: 9780980232776.

NOTE: More material on linear algebra (and much more about differential equations) is in Professor Strang's 2014 textbook _[Differential Equations and Linear Algebra](http://www-math.mit.edu/~gs/dela)_. In 2016, the textbook was developed into a series of 55 short videos, _[Learn Differential Equations: Up Close with Gilbert Strang and Cleve Moler](/courses/res-18-009-learn-differential-equations-up-close-with-gilbert-strang-and-cleve-moler-fall-2015)._

Goals
-----

The goals for 18.06 are using matrices and also understanding them.

Here are key computations and some of the ideas behind them:

1.  Solving Ax = b for square systems by elimination (pivots, multipliers, back substitution, invertibility of A, factorization into A = LU)
2.  Complete solution to Ax = b (column space containing b, rank of A, nullspace of A and special solutions to Ax = 0 from row reduced R)
3.  Basis and dimension (bases for the four fundamental subspaces)
4.  Least squares solutions (closest line by understanding projections)
5.  Orthogonalization by Gram-Schmidt (factorization into A = QR)
6.  Properties of determinants (leading to the cofactor formula and the sum over all n! permutations, applications to inv(A) and volume)
7.  Eigenvalues and eigenvectors (diagonalizing A, computing powers A^k and matrix exponentials to solve difference and differential equations)
8.  Symmetric matrices and positive definite matrices (real eigenvalues and orthogonal eigenvectors, tests for x'Ax > 0, applications)
9.  Linear transformations and change of basis (connected to the Singular Value Decomposition - orthonormal bases that diagonalize A)
10.  Linear algebra in engineering (graphs and networks, Markov matrices, Fourier matrix, Fast Fourier Transform, linear programming)

Homework
--------

The homeworks are essential in learning linear algebra. They are not a test and you are encouraged to talk to other students about difficult problems-after you have found them difficult. Talking about linear algebra is healthy. But you must write your own solutions.

Exams
-----

There will be three one-hour exams at class times and a final exam. The use of calculators or notes is not permitted during the exams.

MATLAB®
-------

Some homework problems will require you to use MATLAB, an important tool for numerical linear algebra. No previous MATLAB experience is required in 18.06. The {{% resource_link 6d4babc3-884f-613c-593e-2df8ac802a95 "related resources" %}} section has links to information about MATLAB, including a tutorial.
