Video cameras record data in a poor format for broadcasting video. To transmit video efficiently, linear algebra is used to change the basis. But which basis is best for video compression is an important question that has not been fully answered!

These video lectures of Professor Gilbert Strang teaching 18.06 were recorded in Fall 1999 and do not correspond precisely to the current edition of the textbook. However, this book is still the best reference for more information on the topics covered in each lecture.
